##Write the for loop that will
##print the following sequences of numbers, one per line.
##(a) Integers from 3 up to and including 12

for a in range(3,13):
    print(a)
print()
##(b) Integers from 0 up to but not including 9,
##but with a step of 2 instead of the default of 1 (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, 8)

for b in range(0, 9, 2):
    print(b)
print()
##(c) Integers from 0 up to but not including 24 with a step of 3

for c in range(0, 24, 3):
    print(c)
print()
##(d) Integers from 3 up to but not including 12 with a step of 5

for d in range(3, 12, 5):
    print(d)
print()
