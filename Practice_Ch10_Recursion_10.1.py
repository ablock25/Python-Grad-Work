##Letâ€™s summarize the process of solving a problem recursively:
##
##    1. First decide on the base case or cases of the problem
##    that can be solved directly, without recursion.
##
##    2. Figure out how to break the problem into one or more subproblems that
##    are closer to the base case; the subproblems are to be solved recursively.
##
##    The solutions to the subproblems are used to construct the solution
##    to the original problem.
